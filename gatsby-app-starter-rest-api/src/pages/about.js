        <hr />
        <p>
          We are team GreenDubs. Green because we work for the environment, dubs
          because we started from the University of Washington (Phonetically,
          its U-Dub). It is the way Huskies Go!

          This project and the code repository is also called,
          <b> Sarjom,</b> the name for the <i>Sal</i> tree in India in the
          language is{' '}

            "Ho"

            Sarjom is known to be one of the most collaborative trees in nature
            and it is said that the Buddha decided to take his final sleep in
            between the Sal trees.

          Our goal is to become the next Wikipedia of citizen science datasets.
          We need all of you to start collecting data about our environment so
          that we can get a better understanding of our planet. Our vision is to
          create sustainable and collaborative technologies for the environment
          and we want to achieve this vision by driving community action for the
          environment and climate change with your help. <br />
          <br />
          Most importantly, we want to train the next generation of leaders to
          develop sustainable technologies for the environment.

        <h2>A brief history</h2>
        <p>
          We were born out of a novel classroom project that led to independent
          research credits and a successful capstone project at the University
          of Washington. Now we want you to join us and branch off our ideas and
          do what needs to be done across the world. Here is a brief
          chronological history of our journey till now
