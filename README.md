# sarjom-ba
Welcome to the code repository of www.citsci.earth . This is version is being developed on Java, MongoDb and React.

Sarjom-ba is the flower of the Sarjom tree. It blossoms once in a while.

Sarjom is the name given to the tree [Shorea robusta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorea_robusta) in the "ho" language. Sarjom represents the guiding philosophy of our software development lifecycle. We want to grow slow like a tree while ensuring the growth and development of all other species, flora and fauna that make up our environment.

## August 2020 - December 2020
Development is spread across individual branches/contributors. We merge changes every month and release a stable build. Currently, we have experimented with our MVP in the Sarjom branch(Mongo, Python & Flask) and will be working towards a more stable version. People call it the Beta.

## Areas of work
We are a research based lab, our goal is to first find out "gaps" in current systems and then use the most appropriate people and technologies to empower communities through open source development.
